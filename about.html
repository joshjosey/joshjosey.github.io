                    Graduating <i>Summa Cum Laude</i> from Texas Tech University with a <strong>B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics</strong>, I am now pursuing an M.S. in Software Engineering & Security. 
                    Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a diverse skill set and deep knowledge in both programming practices and computer science theory. Beyond academics, I actively 
                    engage in leadership and service roles, including serving as an ambassador for the university through President's Select, a member of Mortar Board, and a former executive officer 
                    of Beta Upsilon Chi. My commitment to community service is demonstrated through my weekly volunteer work with my local church. Driven by a passion for innovation, I aspire to 
                    leverage my skills to make meaningful contributions to the field of Computer Science and beyond.

                    In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to study abroad at Texas Tech Costa Rica. This was truly one of the best experiences of my
                    time as a student. During my 10 week program we had the opportunity to visit each province of the country and see some of the most
                    well known places. One of the trips we went on was to the La Fortuna waterfall. After descending the 500 step stairway, getting to see the
                    250 foot waterfall and swim in the basin was an incredible experience. Although all of the excursions were incredible, the truly amazing 
                    part of this experince was the day to day living. Getting a glimpse into another culture and making my best efforts to put duolingo into practice
                    made for an unforgettable journey.

                    In the summer of 2022 I worked as a counselor for Pine Cove Shores, spending around 2 months on 
                    Lake Palestine just outside of Tyler, Texas. <br/>Growing up I was the furthest thing from 
                    a summer camp kid, but in my freshman year at Texas Tech, I believe God opened the door to work here to bring me closer to Him.
                    Going by the camp name www.yoomama.com I led a cabin of around 8 young men each week.
                    During their stay we went through a bible study called FRAME, focused on 
                    looking at yourself and others through the same frame as God. Working at
                    Pine Cove was one of the times in my life where I grew the most as a
                    believer and a leader.

                    One of my favorite things to do in my free time is cook. Being quite
                    a picky eater as a child I have plenty of recipes to try to make up
                    for all of the lost time. Ironically, one of my best meals is the picky
                    eater's favorite: Fried Chicken Tenders. Apart from cooking I also really
                    really enjoy being on the move. Whether working out at the gym, going on a
                    hike or exploring a new city.........
